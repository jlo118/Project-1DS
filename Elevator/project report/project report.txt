Assumptions
1.The program has a elevator class that indivdualizes elevators
2. The elevators each have their own list of passengers that are picked 
from the global wait list
3.A passenger is a struct that contains starting floor, direction their headed,
wait time before they enter the elevator, and floor they want to go to
4.The program cycles through the elevators and wait list 
(think queue in bank where tellers get one person from line each time)
5.Wait time was calculated through average floor a passenger waited to 
enter the elevator
6.We assumed that its better for all elevators to be in use then for a 
elevator to be idle.
7.The point of a global wait list is to avoid the situation where elevators
attempt to pick up the same person

Big-O 
The average Big-O outside of the simulation was N, where N represented the amount
of people that made request.
The O(n) was in the range of 3N to 4N depending on fractions.
To further optimize the code. We could of possibly mesh together some operations
under the same loop umbrella
