Project#1

Team Member
Jariel Long/Yang, Sandy

Both of us were pivotal at every step of the projects development
1. We created a blueprint of the algorithm 
2. We both coded a rough draft of the project
3. We went over each other designs and implemented the final project together
4.Sandy came up with the idea of a waiting list
5. I came up with the idea of a struct to represent a passenger.

What i Learned:
1. I learned that i should compartenmentalize functions.
2. Reduce redudnant code by making a function out of it
3. Planning ahead is esstential
4. Sharing code makes it easier to find bugs
5. Having a single visionary and shot caller keeps code on track and makes it
easier to develop.

Feedback:
I enjoyed the freedom the third option for project#1 allowed.
It replicated a real world scenerio where your given a broad problem and 
have to come up with a solution.
The third option was open ended which made it less intuitive
and require a bit of extra planning during the algorithm rough draft phase.
